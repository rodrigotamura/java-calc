# About 

This is a very simple calculator project using Java and practicing some concepts from OOP, such as:
- Polimorphism ([see here](https://github.com/rodrigotamura/java-calc/blob/master/src/br/com/calc/factories/CalcFactory.java#L13));
- Abstraction ([see here](https://github.com/rodrigotamura/java-calc/blob/master/src/br/com/calc/classes/MathematicalCalculation.java#L5));
- Factory Pattern (I've applied [here](https://github.com/rodrigotamura/java-calc/blob/master/src/br/com/calc/factories/CalcFactory.java));
- Template Method Pattern (I've used [here](https://github.com/rodrigotamura/java-calc/blob/master/src/br/com/calc/classes/MathematicalCalculation.java#L22));
- Encapsulation;
- Interfaces ([see here](https://github.com/rodrigotamura/java-calc/blob/master/src/br/com/calc/interfaces/MathCalculator.java))
